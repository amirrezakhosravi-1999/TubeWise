# TubeWise Key Points Testing

This directory contains various tests for the key points extraction and display functionality of the TubeWise application.

## Overview

The key points extraction feature is a critical component of TubeWise that provides users with timestamped highlights from YouTube videos. These tests ensure that this functionality works correctly across the entire application stack, from the backend API to the frontend display.

## Test Files

### 1. Basic Tests

- `key_points_test.py`: Tests the basic key points extraction functionality by calling the API and verifying that key points are returned for different videos.

### 2. Debugging Tests

- `debug_key_points.py`: A more detailed test that examines the structure of the key points returned by the API, useful for debugging issues with the key points format.

### 3. Frontend Tests

- `key_points_frontend_test.html`: A standalone HTML page that tests the display of key points in a simulated frontend environment.
- `key_points_frontend_test.js`: JavaScript code for testing the key points display functionality.
- `run_key_points_test.bat`: A batch script to open the frontend test in a browser.

### 4. Comprehensive Tests

- `key_points_comprehensive_test.py`: A comprehensive test that checks both the extraction and display of key points, generating an HTML file with the results.
- `test_all_key_points.py`: A master test script that runs all the key points tests in sequence and provides a summary of the results.

## How to Run the Tests

### Running All Tests

To run all key points tests at once:

```bash
python test/test_all_key_points.py
```

This will execute all the tests and open the frontend test in a browser.

### Running Individual Tests

To run specific tests:

1. Basic key points extraction test:
   ```bash
   python test/key_points_test.py
   ```

2. Key points debugging test:
   ```bash
   python test/debug_key_points.py
   ```

3. Comprehensive key points test:
   ```bash
   python test/key_points_comprehensive_test.py
   ```

4. Frontend test:
   ```bash
   ./test/run_key_points_test.bat
   ```

## Test Results

The tests will output results to the console, and some tests will also generate HTML files or open browser windows to display the results visually.

- `key_points_test_result.html`: Generated by the comprehensive test, shows the extracted key points in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

If any tests fail, check the following:

1. Make sure the TubeWise API service is running at http://localhost:8000
2. Verify that the YouTube API key is configured correctly
3. Check that the video URLs used in the tests are valid and accessible
4. Ensure that the frontend code is correctly handling the key points format

## Recent Fixes

The key points functionality has been updated to fix the following issues:

1. Fixed the field name mismatch between frontend and backend (`keyPoints` vs `keyTimestamps`)
2. Updated the field names in the frontend to match the API response (`point` and `timestamp` instead of `text` and `time`)
3. Fixed the timestamp format handling to ensure consistent display and navigation
4. Updated the data models to use string timestamps instead of numeric seconds

These fixes ensure that key points are correctly extracted and displayed for all videos.
